# GSAP-Projects
Welcome to the GSAP Projects repository! 

<h2>Template Project </h2>
<p>
this is my first projected which i created using GSAP. GSAP project leverages powerful animation tools to create dynamic and engaging web experiences. In this project, I utilized various GSAP features such as ScrollTrigger, duration, timeline, delay, stagger, and scrub to enhance the user interface.
ScrollTrigger is used to create scroll-based animations, triggering animations when elements enter or leave the viewport. The delay property introduces pauses before animations begin, providing a controlled and deliberate flow. Stagger is employed to animate multiple elements with a slight delay between each, creating a cascading effect that adds depth and visual interest. Finally, the scrub property ties the animation progress to the scroll position, enabling users to control the animation with their scroll actions.
There are few more properties of GSAP i used to created this template is opacity, scale. yoyo and markers
