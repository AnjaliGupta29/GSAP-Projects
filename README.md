Welcome to the GSAP Projects repository! 

<h2>Template UI </h2>
<p>
This is my first project which i created using GSAP. GSAP project leverages powerful animation tools to create engaging web experiences. In this project, I utilized various GSAP features such as ScrollTrigger, duration, timeline, delay, stagger, and scrub to enhance the user interface.
ScrollTrigger is used to create scroll-based animations, triggering animations when elements enter or leave the viewport. The delay property introduces pauses before animations begin, providing a controlled and deliberate flow. Stagger is employed to animate multiple elements with a slight delay between each, creating a cascading effect that adds depth and visual interest. Finally, the scrub property ties the animation progress to the scroll position, enabling users to control the animation with their scroll actions.
There are few more properties of GSAP i used to created this template is opacity, scale. yoyo and markers

<h2>Space Square UI </h2>
<p>
This project demonstrates a simple yet elegant webpage with animations powered by GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform). The page features a navigation bar with a logo, product sections, and login options, all of which are animated to appear with smooth transitions using GSAP's timeline features. The main content of the page showcases dynamic text animations where key phrases "BOOK NOW" and "SELL" move into view, drawing the user's attention. The use of GSAP's stagger and yoyo effects creates a fluid user experience, making the page visually appealing. Itâ€™s a basic yet engaging example of modern web animation techniques.

<h2>Moqo UI </h2>
<p>In this project, I utilized GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) to implement a smooth scroll-based animation on the X-axis. With GSAP's ScrollTrigger plugin, objects seamlessly move horizontally as the user scrolls through the page, creating a dynamic and engaging user experience. This effect enhances the visual appeal of the single-page UI by adding fluid transitions and interactivity, showcasing the power and flexibility of GSAP for crafting creative animations.</p>
